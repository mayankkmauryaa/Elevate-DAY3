# 📚 Book API

A simple REST API to manage books using Node.js and Express (no database, in-memory storage).

## 🔧 Features

- `GET /books` – List all books
- `POST /books` – Add a new book
- `PUT /books/:id` – Update a book
- `DELETE /books/:id` – Remove a book

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

> npm install

> node index.js


2. Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the API at:
http://localhost:3000



## 🧠 What I Learned
